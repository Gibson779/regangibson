             <p1 className="Me">Hi I'm Regan a wedding photographer inspired by the worlds of art, fashion, and human connection. My work blends documentary observation with editorial styling, creating imagery that feels intentional, elegant, and deeply personal.
                               Every wedding tells its story through design, emotion, and atmosphere. I look for the balance between those – the way light falls, fabric moves, and moments unfold – capturing it all with a fashion-inspired eye.
                               I operate from my own creative space in the heart of Derby; Brickwork Studio, and also run Another Idea, a podcast and YouTube channel that celebrates and discusses the creative industry.
